# 🗞️ The Tik-Tak-Toe Tribune

A vintage newspaper-styled Tik-Tak-Toe web application crafted with strong editorial design principles. This project evokes the charm of 1950s-1970s print media, featuring halftone textures, classic typography, and a functional broadsheet-style interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Vintage Editorial Design**: Pure monochrome (#000000 and #FFFFFF) palette with halftone dot textures and paper overlays.
- **Dynamic Newspaper Layout**: 3-column broadsheet structure on desktop, transitioning to a vertical stack on mobile.
- **Interactive Game Board**: A "crossword-style" grid with serialized "ink-stamp" mark animations (X and O).
- **Match Tracking**: Real-time scoreboard for "Challenger" vs "Defender" and match counting.
- **Player Registry**: Editable player names that sync across the headline status and match logs.
- **Match Results Log**: Timestamped record of game events styled as a "Letters to the Editor" or results section.
- **Print Optimization**: Dedicated "Print Edition" button and CSS styles for a clean physical newspaper output.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic layout using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`.
- **Vanilla CSS3**: 
  - **Typography**: Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Merriweather, Bebas Neue).
  - **Aesthetics**: Radial gradients for halftone effects, CSS animations for "stamping" marks.
  - **Grid/Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsive editorial columns.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: State-based game engine handling win/draw conditions and UI synchronization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The goal was to create a digital game that feels like a physical puzzle pulled from a Sunday newspaper. Every element—from the heavy 4px grid lines to the slight rotation of the "hand-stamped" marks—is designed to maintain the illusion of ink on paper.
